For Developers: Manually Adding a User
--------------------------------------

You can create a new user by running the `generate_transition_data.py` script with command-line arguments.

To create a user without generating sample data, use the `--no-data` flag:
```bash
python generate_transition_data.py \\
    --email "newuser@example.com" \\
    --password "strongpassword123" \\
    --name "New User" \\
    --pronouns "they/them" \\
    --no-data
```

This will create a new user with the specified details and a hashed password, and set `email_verified` to `TRUE`.

If you run the script without any arguments, it will create a default user (`transition_user@example.com`) and generate a large amount of sample vocal data for that user.
